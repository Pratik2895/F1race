## Project Overview  
This project simulates a real-world data engineering solution by:  
- Ingesting raw Formula 1 racing data into **Azure Data Lake Gen2**.  
- Transforming and analyzing the data in **Azure Databricks** using **PySpark** and **Spark SQL**.  
- Leveraging **Delta Lake** for implementing Lakehouse architecture features.  
- Enabling data governance through **Unity Catalog**.  
- Automating data pipelines using **Azure Data Factory**.  
- Visualizing the results with interactive **Power BI dashboards**.  

This project equips you with the skills required to build scalable, secure, and efficient data engineering pipelines using Azure's modern data stack.
